# About me
I am a soon-to-be graduate of the University of Central Florida, earning my degree in May 2025. With a passion for technology and a strong drive to excel, I am eager to begin a career in the IT field. My dedication, hard work, and love for overcoming challenges make me a strong asset in any professional setting. I have various experience using IT related applications like MySQL Workbench, Wireshark, Cisco Packet Tracer, and VirtualBox as well as advanced knowledge of programming languages like HTML, Python, and Javascript. Outside of my passion for technology, I enjoy sports, music, outdoors, and cooking.
